# Machine Learning Notes

This repository consists of Machine Learning Notes. The aim is to prepare theoretical definitions required to brush up on the basic concepts. 

## Topics Covered

- **Regression:** Understanding the relationship between features (input) and response (output).
- **Clustering and Retrieval:** Grouping similar data points and retrieving relevant information.
- **Classification:** Assigning data points to predefined categories.
- **Introduction to Generative AI:** Basics of generative models and their applications.
- **Introduction to Large Language Models (LLM):** Overview of large language models and their capabilities.
- **NLP Classification with Vector Spaces:** Techniques for text classification using vector space models.
- **Generative AI with LLM:** Advanced topics in generative AI using large language models.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAGs):** Combining retrieval and generation for improved performance.

## Purpose

The purpose of these notes is to provide a comprehensive understanding of fundamental machine learning concepts and advanced topics. These notes are intended for students, researchers, and practitioners who want to strengthen their theoretical knowledge in machine learning.

## Formats

The notes are available in two formats:
- **Markdown:** Suitable for quick reading and reference.
- **Notebook:** Provides an ore clearer mathematical equation(as the equations are built in latex).

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate through the different topics to study the theoretical definitions and concepts.
3. Use the notes as a reference for your machine learning projects and research.
