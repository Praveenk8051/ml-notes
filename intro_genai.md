# Introduction to Generative AI

## 1. Understanding AI, Machine Learning & Deep Learning

Before diving into Generative AI (GenAI), the course first explains the fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML):

- **AI** is a branch of computer science that creates intelligent systems that can reason, learn, and act autonomously.
- **Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of AI where models learn from data instead of being explicitly programmed.

### Types of ML models:

- **Supervised Learning:** Uses labeled data to train models (e.g., predicting tips based on past restaurant bills).
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Works with unlabeled data to find hidden patterns (e.g., clustering employees based on tenure and income).

## 2. Deep Learning & Neural Networks

- **Deep Learning (DL)** is a subset of ML that uses artificial neural networks to process complex patterns in data.
- **Neural Networks** mimic the human brain with interconnected nodes (neurons).
- **Semi-supervised learning:** Uses a mix of labeled and unlabeled data to train models.

## 3. Where Does Generative AI Fit In?

- **Generative AI** is a subset of Deep Learning, meaning it leverages artificial neural networks.
- Generative AI differs from traditional ML:
  - **Discriminative models** classify data points (e.g., is this image a dog or cat?).
  - **Generative models** learn the probability distribution of data and generate new data points (e.g., creating an entirely new image of a dog).

## 4. What Can Generative AI Do?

Generative AI creates new content rather than just classifying existing data. Some examples include:

- **Text Generation** (e.g., Chatbots, LLMs like Gemini and LaMDA)
- **Image Generation** (e.g., Stable Diffusion)
- **Audio and Video Generation** (e.g., AI-generated music or deepfake videos)
- **Code Generation** (e.g., AI-assisted programming)
- **3D Model Generation** (e.g., creating 3D assets for video games)

## 5. Generative AI vs Traditional ML

A traditional ML model predicts an output (e.g., a number or class label), whereas a Generative AI model learns patterns and creates new content.

- **Example:** If input = “What is sales?”, a traditional ML model might predict a probability (e.g., likelihood of a sale), while a GenAI model would generate a full-text definition.

## 6. Large Language Models (LLMs)

LLMs are a subset of Generative AI that process text-based inputs and generate human-like text.

### How do they work?

- Given an input prompt, they predict the next word based on probabilities from training data.
- **Example:** “I’m making a sandwich with peanut butter and…” → likely response: “jelly”.

## 7. The Role of Transformers in Generative AI

Transformers revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) in 2018.

- A transformer consists of an encoder-decoder structure:
  - The encoder processes the input.
  - The decoder generates the output.
- While powerful, transformers can hallucinate (generate incorrect or nonsensical content).

## 8. Prompt Engineering: Controlling AI Outputs

- A prompt is the input text given to an AI model to guide its output.
- Prompt design is crucial to obtaining high-quality AI responses.

## 9. Types of Generative AI Models

Different models serve different input-output functions:

- **Text-to-Text:** Language translation, summarization (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini).
- **Text-to-Image:** Generates images from text prompts (e.g., DALL·E, Stable Diffusion).
- **Text-to-Video:** Generates videos from text prompts.
- **Text-to-3D:** Creates 3D models from text descriptions.
- **Text-to-Task:** Automates workflows, assists with web navigation, or modifies documents.

## 10. Foundation Models: The Backbone of Generative AI

Foundation models are large AI models pre-trained on massive datasets and can be fine-tuned for specific applications.

### Examples:

- **LLMs** (e.g., Gemini, LaMDA)
- **Vision models** (e.g., Stable Diffusion for image generation)
- **Code models** (e.g., AI-assisted coding, debugging, and SQL query generation)

## 11. Google Cloud’s Generative AI Tools

Google Cloud offers tools for developers and businesses:

- **Vertex AI Studio:** Helps developers build and deploy Generative AI models.
- **Vertex AI Agent Builder:** Enables low-code/no-code AI solutions for chatbots, digital assistants, and knowledge bases.
- **Gemini AI:** A multimodal model capable of handling text, images, audio, and code.

## 12. Applications of Generative AI

Generative AI is being used in many industries:

- **Healthcare:** Drug discovery, patient diagnosis.
- **Finance:** Fraud detection, risk assessment.
- **Customer Support:** Chatbots, automated responses.
- **Education:** Personalized learning content.
- **Entertainment & Creativity:** AI-generated music, writing, and gaming assets.
