    "# Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification is one of the most widely used and fundamental areas of Machine Learning. It focuses on building models that assign discrete labels to inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A classifier maps input features (X) to an output class (Y).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- Spam filters classify emails as spam or not spam.\n",
    "- Multi-class classification: Categorizing content (e.g., an ad system determining if a webpage is about finance, education, or technology).\n",
    "- Image classification: Predicting the category of an image (e.g., dog breeds in ImageNet).\n",
    "- Medical applications: Personalized medicine can use classification models to predict the best treatment based on DNA and lifestyle.\n",
    "- Mind-reading models: fMRI-based classifiers can predict what a person is thinking by analyzing brain scans.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is Classification Important?**\n",
    "- Used everywhere: spam detection, web search ranking, medical diagnosis, and recommendation systems.\n",
    "- Core techniques apply to almost all supervised learning problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. What is a Linear Classifier?\n",
    "\n",
    "A linear classifier predicts whether an input belongs to one class (+1) or another (-1) by computing a weighted sum of input features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Sentiment Analysis**\n",
    "- A classifier assigns weights to words in a review.\n",
    "- Positive words (e.g., \"awesome\") have positive weights.\n",
    "- Negative words (e.g., \"awful\") have negative weights.\n",
    "- If the overall score is > 0, it’s classified as positive; otherwise, it's negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Decision Boundaries in Linear Classifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision boundary is a hyperplane (a line in 2D, a plane in 3D, and so on) that separates classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- \"Awesome\" has a weight of +1.0, \"Awful\" has a weight of -1.5.\n",
    "- If a sentence contains more \"awesomes\" than \"awfuls,\" it gets classified as positive.\n",
    "- The boundary equation:\n",
    "  $\n",
    "  1.0 \\times (\\# \\text{awesomes}) - 1.5 \\times (\\# \\text{awfuls}) = 0\n",
    "  $\n",
    "- Everything below the line is classified as positive.\n",
    "- Everything above the line is classified as negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Logistic Regression: Moving Beyond Just Labels\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression extends linear classifiers by predicting probabilities instead of hard labels. The output is not just \"positive\" or \"negative\" but a confidence score.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- “The sushi & everything was awesome!” → 99% probability of positive\n",
    "- “The sushi was good, the service was okay.” → 55% probability of positive\n",
    "\n",
    "This is useful when some classifications are uncertain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Quick Review of Probability Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- Probability is always between 0 and 1.\n",
    "- Sum of all probabilities = 1.\n",
    "- Conditional probability: The probability of an event given some condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "$\n",
    "P(\\text{review is positive} \\mid \\text{contains \"awesome\"}) = 0.9\n",
    "$\n",
    "This means that, given a review contains \"awesome,\" 90% of such reviews are positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Logistic Regression & the Sigmoid Function\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we convert a score (which ranges from -∞ to +∞) into a probability (0 to 1)? The answer: The Sigmoid Function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:**\n",
    "$\n",
    "P(y = +1 \\mid x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-w^T x}}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Properties:**\n",
    "- If score → +∞, probability → 1 (very confident positive).\n",
    "- If score → -∞, probability → 0 (very confident negative).\n",
    "- If score = 0, probability = 0.5 (uncertain).\n",
    "\n",
    "Sigmoid acts as a \"squashing function,\" keeping outputs between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Learning Logistic Regression from Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Process:**\n",
    "- Training Data → Feature Extraction → Learn Parameters $ w $ → Predict Sentiment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Likelihood Function:**\n",
    "- Measures how good a set of parameters $ w $ is for classification.\n",
    "- Example: Different decision boundaries will give different likelihood scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Categorical Features & One-Hot Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning models handle numeric data better than categorical data (e.g., \"Country\" or \"Gender\").\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Convert categorical variables into one-hot vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Instead of \"Country: Brazil,\" we create binary features:\n",
    "  - Argentina → 0\n",
    "  - Brazil → 1\n",
    "  - Zimbabwe → 0\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bag-of-Words Encoding** is a common technique for text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Sentence: \"The sushi was amazing, but service was slow.\"\n",
    "- Convert it into:\n",
    "  - $ h_1 = 1 $ (number of “amazing”)\n",
    "  - $ h_2 = 1 $ (number of “slow”)\n",
    "  - $ h_3 = 1 $ (number of “sushi”)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Multi-Class Classification with One-vs-All\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is binary, but what if we have more than two classes?\n",
    "\n",
    "**One-vs-All Strategy:**\n",
    "- Train one classifier per class, treating it as class vs. everything else.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Triangle, Heart, Donut**\n",
    "- Classifier 1: Is it a triangle vs. not a triangle?\n",
    "- Classifier 2: Is it a heart vs. not a heart?\n",
    "- Classifier 3: Is it a donut vs. not a donut?\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose the class with the highest probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Quick Recap of Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Learn a classifier that predicts $ P(y \\mid x) $, where $ y $ is the output label (positive or negative sentiment), and $ x $ is the input (e.g., a restaurant review).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logistic regression assigns weights ($ w $) to input features (e.g., words in a review) and computes a score.\n",
    "- This score is passed through the sigmoid function to squash it between 0 and 1, giving a probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. Learning the Parameters ($ w $)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Find the best weights ($ w $) so that the model accurately classifies inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Training data consists of ($ x, y $) pairs, where $ x $ is the input, and $ y $ is the true label (positive or negative).\n",
    "- We want to maximize the probability of correct classifications across all training examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11. The Likelihood Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The likelihood function quantifies how well a model fits the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Higher likelihood = better model fit.\n",
    "- Given a dataset of $ N $ examples:\n",
    "  - For positive examples, we maximize $ P(y = +1 \\mid x, w) $.\n",
    "  - For negative examples, we maximize $ P(y = -1 \\mid x, w) $.\n",
    "- The overall likelihood function is the product of probabilities across all training examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Computing Likelihood**\n",
    "- Suppose we have 4 reviews:\n",
    "  - (2 \"awesomes\", 1 \"awful\", positive review) → Want high $ P(y = +1 \\mid x) $\n",
    "  - (0 \"awesomes\", 2 \"awfuls\", negative review) → Want high $ P(y = -1 \\mid x) $\n",
    "\n",
    "**Likelihood function:**\n",
    "$\n",
    "L(w) = P(y_1 \\mid x_1, w) \\times P(y_2 \\mid x_2, w) \\times \\ldots \\times P(y_N \\mid x_N, w)\n",
    "$\n",
    "We seek $ w $ that maximizes this likelihood function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12. Why Use Log Likelihood Instead?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since likelihood is a product of many probabilities, it results in very small values. Instead of maximizing $ L(w) $, we maximize its log (log-likelihood function), which turns the product into a sum:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\log L(w) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\log P(y_i \\mid x_i, w)\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the log simplifies calculations and makes optimization easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 13. Optimization: Gradient Ascent\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient ascent is used to find the optimal weights $ w $ that maximize the log-likelihood function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key idea:** Start with random weights and iteratively adjust them in the direction of increasing likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gradient Ascent Algorithm:**\n",
    "1. Initialize $ w $ randomly.\n",
    "2. Compute the gradient (how much each weight should change).\n",
    "3. Update each weight using:\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   w_j = w_j + \\eta \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\log L}{\\partial w_j}\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   - $ \\eta $ (step size) controls how big the update is.\n",
    "4. Stop when updates become small (converged).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 14. How the Gradient Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient measures the direction and magnitude of change needed for each weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula for updating $ w_j $:**\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial \\log L}{\\partial w_j} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - P(y_i = +1 \\mid x_i, w)) \\cdot x_{ij}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- If a positive review is misclassified as negative, increase weights for positive words.\n",
    "- If a negative review is misclassified as positive, decrease weights for negative words.\n",
    "- If a review is classified correctly, don’t change much.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 15. Step Size ($ \\eta $) & Learning Rate Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the right step size ($ \\eta $) is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If $ \\eta $ is too small: The model learns slowly, taking too long to converge.\n",
    "- If $ \\eta $ is too large: The model oscillates or diverges, failing to find the optimal weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Find the Best Step Size?**\n",
    "- Learning curves: Track log-likelihood over iterations.\n",
    "  - Too small $ \\eta $ → Converges slowly.\n",
    "  - Too large $ \\eta $ → Wild oscillations.\n",
    "  - Optimal $ \\eta $ → Smooth increase in log-likelihood, reaching a maximum efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 16. Interpretation of Updates\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a training example is classified correctly, little to no change in weights.\n",
    "- If an example is misclassified:\n",
    "  - If it should be positive, increase its word weights.\n",
    "  - If it should be negative, decrease its word weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Calculation:**\n",
    "- Suppose a review has 2 “awesomes”, 1 “awful”, and is positive.\n",
    "- If the current model predicts 0.5 probability, the update is:\n",
    "  $\n",
    "  w_j = w_j + \\eta \\cdot (1 - 0.5) \\cdot 2\n",
    "  $\n",
    "  Increase $ w_j $ since the model was uncertain about a positive review.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 17. Final Gradient Ascent Algorithm for Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize weights $ w $ randomly.\n",
    "2. Repeat until convergence:\n",
    "   - For each weight $ w_j $, update using:\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     w_j = w_j + \\eta \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - P(y_i = +1 \\mid x_i, w)) \\cdot x_{ij}\n",
    "     $\n",
    "3. Stop when updates are very small.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The algorithm iteratively adjusts weights to maximize the log-likelihood function, converging to the best weights for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Overfitting in Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting happens when a model performs well on training data but fails to generalize to new data. In classification, overfitting can cause:\n",
    "- Overly complex decision boundaries.\n",
    "- Extremely high confidence in wrong predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** A classifier that perfectly fits training data might memorize noise rather than learn general patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Measuring Classification Error\n",
    "\n",
    "We evaluate classifiers using classification error:\n",
    "$ \\text{Error} = \\frac{\\text{Number of misclassified examples}}{\\text{Total number of examples}} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy = 1 - Error. Classifiers should be evaluated on a separate validation set to detect overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Overfitting Looks in Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting can happen in logistic regression when decision boundaries become too complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- A simple linear classifier correctly separates most data.\n",
    "- A quadratic classifier captures more nuances, improving accuracy.\n",
    "- A high-degree polynomial (e.g., degree 20) creates wildly complex decision boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Complex boundaries don’t generalize and may misclassify new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Signs of Overfitting:**\n",
    "- Decision boundaries become highly irregular.\n",
    "- Large coefficient values (weights become extreme).\n",
    "- Extreme confidence (probabilities near 0 or 1) for uncertain cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overconfidence in Overfit Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression models output probabilities, but overfit models push probabilities toward 0 or 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** A review with 2 \"awesomes\" and 1 \"awful\" should have a reasonable probability (e.g., 73%) of being positive. If coefficients become too large, the model wrongly becomes 99.7% sure it's positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** The model loses uncertainty and becomes overconfident in wrong predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regularization: Preventing Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: Regularization penalizes large weights, making the model simpler and more generalizable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two types of regularization:**\n",
    "- **L2 Regularization (Ridge Regression in Regression):** Penalizes large weights using sum of squared coefficients:\n",
    "  $ \\lambda \\sum w_j^2 $\n",
    "  Helps reduce overfitting while maintaining smooth decision boundaries.\n",
    "  **Effects:**\n",
    "  - Keeps coefficients small but nonzero.\n",
    "  - Prevents extreme decision boundaries.\n",
    "  - Balances training fit vs. generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **L1 Regularization (Lasso in Regression):** Penalizes large weights using sum of absolute values:\n",
    "  $ \\lambda \\sum |w_j| $\n",
    "  Encourages sparsity → many weights become exactly 0.\n",
    "  Useful when working with high-dimensional data (e.g., spam detection with thousands of features).\n",
    "  **Effects:**\n",
    "  - Fewer active features (improves interpretability & efficiency).\n",
    "  - Sparse solutions → only important features remain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Regularization Improves Generalization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Applying L2 Regularization on a Degree-20 Model\n",
    "- Without regularization → crazy decision boundary, large coefficients (3000+).\n",
    "- With L2 regularization → smooth, well-behaved boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Effect on Probabilities:**\n",
    "- Without regularization → Overconfident probabilities (near 0 or 1).\n",
    "- With regularization → Reasonable confidence levels (proper uncertainty maintained).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementing Regularization with Gradient Ascent\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Ascent for Regularized Logistic Regression:\n",
    "The update rule adds a penalty term:\n",
    "$ w_j = w_j + \\eta \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - P(y_i = +1 \\mid x_i, w)) x_{ij} - 2\\lambda w_j \\right) $\n",
    "\n",
    "**Effect:**\n",
    "- Reduces large coefficients over time.\n",
    "- Helps maintain smooth, generalizable decision boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation Change:** Only one small change! Add $-2\\lambda w_j$ to your existing gradient ascent code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## L1 Regularization & Sparsity\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 Regularization shrinks some coefficients to exactly zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is this useful?**\n",
    "- Reduces computation (faster predictions).\n",
    "- Improves interpretability (removes unnecessary features).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Word Importance in Sentiment Analysis**\n",
    "- L2 Regularization: Words like “great”, “bad”, and “disappointed” get small weights.\n",
    "- L1 Regularization: Some words get completely removed (zero weight), leaving only the most important.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Choose the Right Regularization Parameter (λ)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- λ too small → Overfitting still happens.\n",
    "- λ too large → Model oversimplifies (underfitting).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best approach:** Use cross-validation or a validation set to tune λ.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Reality of Missing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous modules, we assumed that every data point had all feature values.\n",
    "In reality, datasets are often incomplete:\n",
    "- Loan applications may be missing income or credit history.\n",
    "- Medical records may lack certain test results.\n",
    "- Customer data may have unknown age, address, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing data can impact ML models at:\n",
    "- Training time → We can’t properly train if features are missing.\n",
    "- Prediction time → The model doesn’t know what to do with missing inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Approaches to Handling Missing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We discuss three main strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Approach | Pros | Cons |\n",

    "| Modifying the Model to Handle Missing Data | More accurate, adapts to missing values | Requires modifying algorithms |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach 1: Skipping Missing Data (Purification)\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest solution: Remove rows or features with missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two options:**\n",
    "1. Skip rows with missing values (Reduces dataset size).\n",
    "2. Skip entire features if too many values are missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "| Credit | Term | Income | Risky Loan? |\n",
    "|--------|------|--------|-------------|\n",
    "| Poor | 3Y | High | Yes |\n",
    "| Fair | ? | High | No |\n",
    "| Excellent | 5Y | ? | No |\n",
    "\n",
    "- If only a few rows have missing values, dropping them is fine.\n",
    "- If many values are missing, removing them may destroy useful data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problems with Skipping Data**\n",
    "- ❌ If many rows are removed, we lose valuable information.\n",
    "- ❌ If many features are dropped, we may miss important patterns.\n",
    "- ❌ Doesn’t solve the issue at prediction time (what if a missing value appears in new data?).\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Good when missing values are rare, but not a scalable solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach 2: Imputation (Filling in Missing Values)\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of removing missing data, we fill it in using estimated values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** If 70% of loans are 3-year loans, replace missing “Term” values with 3 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Imputation Strategies:**\n",
    "- For Categorical Features (e.g., Credit Score: Excellent/Fair/Poor)\n",
    "  - Replace missing values with the most common category.\n",
    "- For Numerical Features (e.g., Income)\n",
    "  - Replace missing values with the mean/median of the observed values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problems with Simple Imputation**\n",
    "- ❌ Can introduce bias (e.g., assuming everyone missing \"age\" is 40).\n",
    "- ❌ Can misrepresent reality (e.g., assuming all missing loans are 3-year loans).\n",
    "- ❌ May not be correct at prediction time.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Better than skipping data, but introduces systematic errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach 3: Modifying Decision Trees to Handle Missing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of skipping or guessing, modify decision trees to handle missing values natively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Does This Work?**\n",
    "- Allow the model to learn how to deal with missing values.\n",
    "- Modify decision trees to assign missing values to a specific branch.\n",
    "- **Example:** If Income is missing, send it down the \"Low Income\" branch.\n",
    "- This optimizes tree splits to minimize classification error.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Making Decision Trees Robust to Missing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, decision trees split on features (e.g., Credit Score).\n",
    "But if Credit Score is missing, what should we do?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Assign missing values to the best branch based on past# Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification is one of the most widely used and fundamental areas of Machine Learning. It focuses on building models that assign discrete labels to inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A classifier maps input features (X) to an output class (Y).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- Spam filters classify emails as spam or not spam.\n",
    "- Multi-class classification: Categorizing content (e.g., an ad system determining if a webpage is about finance, education, or technology).\n",
    "- Image classification: Predicting the category of an image (e.g., dog breeds in ImageNet).\n",
    "- Medical applications: Personalized medicine can use classification models to predict the best treatment based on DNA and lifestyle.\n",
    "- Mind-reading models: fMRI-based classifiers can predict what a person is thinking by analyzing brain scans.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is Classification Important?**\n",
    "- Used everywhere: spam detection, web search ranking, medical diagnosis, and recommendation systems.\n",
    "- Core techniques apply to almost all supervised learning problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. What is a Linear Classifier?\n",
    "\n",
    "A linear classifier predicts whether an input belongs to one class (+1) or another (-1) by computing a weighted sum of input features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Sentiment Analysis**\n",
    "- A classifier assigns weights to words in a review.\n",
    "- Positive words (e.g., \"awesome\") have positive weights.\n",
    "- Negative words (e.g., \"awful\") have negative weights.\n",
    "- If the overall score is > 0, it’s classified as positive; otherwise, it's negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Decision Boundaries in Linear Classifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision boundary is a hyperplane (a line in 2D, a plane in 3D, and so on) that separates classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- \"Awesome\" has a weight of +1.0, \"Awful\" has a weight of -1.5.\n",
    "- If a sentence contains more \"awesomes\" than \"awfuls,\" it gets classified as positive.\n",
    "- The boundary equation:\n",
    "  $\n",
    "  1.0 \\times (\\# \\text{awesomes}) - 1.5 \\times (\\# \\text{awfuls}) = 0\n",
    "  $\n",
    "- Everything below the line is classified as positive.\n",
    "- Everything above the line is classified as negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Logistic Regression: Moving Beyond Just Labels\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression extends linear classifiers by predicting probabilities instead of hard labels. The output is not just \"positive\" or \"negative\" but a confidence score.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- “The sushi & everything was awesome!” → 99% probability of positive\n",
    "- “The sushi was good, the service was okay.” → 55% probability of positive\n",
    "\n",
    "This is useful when some classifications are uncertain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Quick Review of Probability Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- Probability is always between 0 and 1.\n",
    "- Sum of all probabilities = 1.\n",
    "- Conditional probability: The probability of an event given some condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "$\n",
    "P(\\text{review is positive} \\mid \\text{contains \"awesome\"}) = 0.9\n",
    "$\n",
    "This means that, given a review contains \"awesome,\" 90% of such reviews are positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Logistic Regression & the Sigmoid Function\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we convert a score (which ranges from -∞ to +∞) into a probability (0 to 1)? The answer: The Sigmoid Function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:**\n",
    "$\n",
    "P(y = +1 \\mid x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-w^T x}}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Properties:**\n",
    "- If score → +∞, probability → 1 (very confident positive).\n",
    "- If score → -∞, probability → 0 (very confident negative).\n",
    "- If score = 0, probability = 0.5 (uncertain).\n",
    "\n",
    "Sigmoid acts as a \"squashing function,\" keeping outputs between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Learning Logistic Regression from Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Process:**\n",
    "- Training Data → Feature Extraction → Learn Parameters $ w $ → Predict Sentiment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Likelihood Function:**\n",
    "- Measures how good a set of parameters $ w $ is for classification.\n",
    "- Example: Different decision boundaries will give different likelihood scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Categorical Features & One-Hot Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning models handle numeric data better than categorical data (e.g., \"Country\" or \"Gender\").\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Convert categorical variables into one-hot vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Instead of \"Country: Brazil,\" we create binary features:\n",
    "  - Argentina → 0\n",
    "  - Brazil → 1\n",
    "  - Zimbabwe → 0\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bag-of-Words Encoding** is a common technique for text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Sentence: \"The sushi was amazing, but service was slow.\"\n",
    "- Convert it into:\n",
    "  - $ h_1 = 1 $ (number of “amazing”)\n",
    "  - $ h_2 = 1 $ (number of “slow”)\n",
    "  - $ h_3 = 1 $ (number of “sushi”)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Multi-Class Classification with One-vs-All\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is binary, but what if we have more than two classes?\n",
    "\n",
    "**One-vs-All Strategy:**\n",
    "- Train one classifier per class, treating it as class vs. everything else.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Triangle, Heart, Donut**\n",
    "- Classifier 1: Is it a triangle vs. not a triangle?\n",
    "- Classifier 2: Is it a heart vs. not a heart?\n",
    "- Classifier 3: Is it a donut vs. not a donut?\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose the class with the highest probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Quick Recap of Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Learn a classifier that predicts $ P(y \\mid x) $, where $ y $ is the output label (positive or negative sentiment), and $ x $ is the input (e.g., a restaurant review).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logistic regression assigns weights ($ w $) to input features (e.g., words in a review) and computes a score.\n",
    "- This score is passed through the sigmoid function to squash it between 0 and 1, giving a probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. Learning the Parameters ($ w $)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Find the best weights ($ w $) so that the model accurately classifies inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Training data consists of ($ x, y $) pairs, where $ x $ is the input, and $ y $ is the true label (positive or negative).\n",
    "- We want to maximize the probability of correct classifications across all training examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11. The Likelihood Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The likelihood function quantifies how well a model fits the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Higher likelihood = better model fit.\n",
    "- Given a dataset of $ N $ examples:\n",
    "  - For positive examples, we maximize $ P(y = +1 \\mid x, w) $.\n",
    "  - For negative examples, we maximize $ P(y = -1 \\mid x, w) $.\n",
    "- The overall likelihood function is the product of probabilities across all training examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Computing Likelihood**\n",
    "- Suppose we have 4 reviews:\n",
    "  - (2 \"awesomes\", 1 \"awful\", positive review) → Want high $ P(y = +1 \\mid x) $\n",
    "  - (0 \"awesomes\", 2 \"awfuls\", negative review) → Want high $ P(y = -1 \\mid x) $\n",
    "\n",
    "**Likelihood function:**\n",
    "$\n",
    "L(w) = P(y_1 \\mid x_1, w) \\times P(y_2 \\mid x_2, w) \\times \\ldots \\times P(y_N \\mid x_N, w)\n",
    "$\n",
    "We seek $ w $ that maximizes this likelihood function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12. Why Use Log Likelihood Instead?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since likelihood is a product of many probabilities, it results in very small values. Instead of maximizing $ L(w) $, we maximize its log (log-likelihood function), which turns the product into a sum:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\log L(w) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\log P(y_i \\mid x_i, w)\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the log simplifies calculations and makes optimization easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 13. Optimization: Gradient Ascent\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient ascent is used to find the optimal weights $ w $ that maximize the log-likelihood function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key idea:** Start with random weights and iteratively adjust them in the direction of increasing likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gradient Ascent Algorithm:**\n",
    "1. Initialize $ w $ randomly.\n",
    "2. Compute the gradient (how much each weight should change).\n",
    "3. Update each weight using:\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   w_j = w_j + \\eta \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\log L}{\\partial w_j}\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   - $ \\eta $ (step size) controls how big the update is.\n",
    "4. Stop when updates become small (converged).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 14. How the Gradient Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient measures the direction and magnitude of change needed for each weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula for updating $ w_j $:**\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial \\log L}{\\partial w_j} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - P(y_i = +1 \\mid x_i, w)) \\cdot x_{ij}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- If a positive review is misclassified as negative, increase weights for positive words.\n",
    "- If a negative review is misclassified as positive, decrease weights for negative words.\n",
    "- If a review is classified correctly, don’t change much.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 15. Step Size ($ \\eta $) & Learning Rate Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the right step size ($ \\eta $) is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If $ \\eta $ is too small: The model learns slowly, taking too long to converge.\n",
    "- If $ \\eta $ is too large: The model oscillates or diverges, failing to find the optimal weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Find the Best Step Size?**\n",
    "- Learning curves: Track log-likelihood over iterations.\n",
    "  - Too small $ \\eta $ → Converges slowly.\n",
    "  - Too large $ \\eta $ → Wild oscillations.\n",
    "  - Optimal $ \\eta $ → Smooth increase in log-likelihood, reaching a maximum efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 16. Interpretation of Updates\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a training example is classified correctly, little to no change in weights.\n",
    "- If an example is misclassified:\n",
    "  - If it should be positive, increase its word weights.\n",
    "  - If it should be negative, decrease its word weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Calculation:**\n",
    "- Suppose a review has 2 “awesomes”, 1 “awful”, and is positive.\n",
    "- If the current model predicts 0.5 probability, the update is:\n",
    "  $\n",
    "  w_j = w_j + \\eta \\cdot (1 - 0.5) \\cdot 2\n",
    "  $\n",
    "  Increase $ w_j $ since the model was uncertain about a positive review.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 17. Final Gradient Ascent Algorithm for Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize weights $ w $ randomly.\n",
    "2. Repeat until convergence:\n",
    "   - For each weight $ w_j $, update using:\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     w_j = w_j + \\eta \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - P(y_i = +1 \\mid x_i, w)) \\cdot x_{ij}\n",
    "     $\n",
    "3. Stop when updates are very small.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The algorithm iteratively adjusts weights to maximize the log-likelihood function, converging to the best weights for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Overfitting in Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting happens when a model performs well on training data but fails to generalize to new data. In classification, overfitting can cause:\n",
    "- Overly complex decision boundaries.\n",
    "- Extremely high confidence in wrong predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** A classifier that perfectly fits training data might memorize noise rather than learn general patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Measuring Classification Error\n",
    "\n",
    "We evaluate classifiers using classification error:\n",
    "$ \\text{Error} = \\frac{\\text{Number of misclassified examples}}{\\text{Total number of examples}} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy = 1 - Error. Classifiers should be evaluated on a separate validation set to detect overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Overfitting Looks in Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting can happen in logistic regression when decision boundaries become too complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- A simple linear classifier correctly separates most data.\n",
    "- A quadratic classifier captures more nuances, improving accuracy.\n",
    "- A high-degree polynomial (e.g., degree 20) creates wildly complex decision boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Complex boundaries don’t generalize and may misclassify new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Signs of Overfitting:**\n",
    "- Decision boundaries become highly irregular.\n",
    "- Large coefficient values (weights become extreme).\n",
    "- Extreme confidence (probabilities near 0 or 1) for uncertain cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overconfidence in Overfit Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression models output probabilities, but overfit models push probabilities toward 0 or 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** A review with 2 \"awesomes\" and 1 \"awful\" should have a reasonable probability (e.g., 73%) of being positive. If coefficients become too large, the model wrongly becomes 99.7% sure it's positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** The model loses uncertainty and becomes overconfident in wrong predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regularization: Preventing Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: Regularization penalizes large weights, making the model simpler and more generalizable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two types of regularization:**\n",
    "- **L2 Regularization (Ridge Regression in Regression):** Penalizes large weights using sum of squared coefficients:\n",
    "  $ \\lambda \\sum w_j^2 $\n",
    "  Helps reduce overfitting while maintaining smooth decision boundaries.\n",
    "  **Effects:**\n",
    "  - Keeps coefficients small but nonzero.\n",
    "  - Prevents extreme decision boundaries.\n",
    "  - Balances training fit vs. generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **L1 Regularization (Lasso in Regression):** Penalizes large weights using sum of absolute values:\n",
    "  $ \\lambda \\sum |w_j| $\n",
    "  Encourages sparsity → many weights become exactly 0.\n",
    "  Useful when working with high-dimensional data (e.g., spam detection with thousands of features).\n",
    "  **Effects:**\n",
    "  - Fewer active features (improves interpretability & efficiency).\n",
    "  - Sparse solutions → only important features remain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Regularization Improves Generalization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Applying L2 Regularization on a Degree-20 Model\n",
    "- Without regularization → crazy decision boundary, large coefficients (3000+).\n",
    "- With L2 regularization → smooth, well-behaved boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Effect on Probabilities:**\n",
    "- Without regularization → Overconfident probabilities (near 0 or 1).\n",
    "- With regularization → Reasonable confidence levels (proper uncertainty maintained).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementing Regularization with Gradient Ascent\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Ascent for Regularized Logistic Regression:\n",
    "The update rule adds a penalty term:\n",
    "$ w_j = w_j + \\eta \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - P(y_i = +1 \\mid x_i, w)) x_{ij} - 2\\lambda w_j \\right) $\n",
    "\n",
    "**Effect:**\n",
    "- Reduces large coefficients over time.\n",
    "- Helps maintain smooth, generalizable decision boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation Change:** Only one small change! Add $-2\\lambda w_j$ to your existing gradient ascent code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## L1 Regularization & Sparsity\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 Regularization shrinks some coefficients to exactly zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is this useful?**\n",
    "- Reduces computation (faster predictions).\n",
    "- Improves interpretability (removes unnecessary features).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Word Importance in Sentiment Analysis**\n",
    "- L2 Regularization: Words like “great”, “bad”, and “disappointed” get small weights.\n",
    "- L1 Regularization: Some words get completely removed (zero weight), leaving only the most important.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Choose the Right Regularization Parameter (λ)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- λ too small → Overfitting still happens.\n",
    "- λ too large → Model oversimplifies (underfitting).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best approach:** Use cross-validation or a validation set to tune λ.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Reality of Missing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous modules, we assumed that every data point had all feature values.\n",
    "In reality, datasets are often incomplete:\n",
    "- Loan applications may be missing income or credit history.\n",
    "- Medical records may lack certain test results.\n",
    "- Customer data may have unknown age, address, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing data can impact ML models at:\n",
    "- Training time → We can’t properly train if features are missing.\n",
    "- Prediction time → The model doesn’t know what to do with missing inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Approaches to Handling Missing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We discuss three main strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Approach | Pros | Cons |\n",
    "|----------|------|------|\n",
    "| Skipping Missing Data | Simple, easy to implement | Reduces dataset size, risks removing valuable information |\n",
    "| Imputation (Filling Missing Values) | Preserves data | Introduces bias, makes incorrect assumptions |\n",
    "| Modifying the Model to Handle Missing Data | More accurate, adapts to missing values | Requires modifying algorithms |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach 1: Skipping Missing Data (Purification)\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest solution: Remove rows or features with missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two options:**\n",
    "1. Skip rows with missing values (Reduces dataset size).\n",
    "2. Skip entire features if too many values are missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "| Credit | Term | Income | Risky Loan? |\n",
    "|--------|------|--------|-------------|\n",
    "| Poor | 3Y | High | Yes |\n",
    "| Fair | ? | High | No |\n",
    "| Excellent | 5Y | ? | No |\n",
    "\n",
    "- If only a few rows have missing values, dropping them is fine.\n",
    "- If many values are missing, removing them may destroy useful data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problems with Skipping Data**\n",
    "- ❌ If many rows are removed, we lose valuable information.\n",
    "- ❌ If many features are dropped, we may miss important patterns.\n",
    "- ❌ Doesn’t solve the issue at prediction time (what if a missing value appears in new data?).\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Good when missing values are rare, but not a scalable solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach 2: Imputation (Filling in Missing Values)\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of removing missing data, we fill it in using estimated values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** If 70% of loans are 3-year loans, replace missing “Term” values with 3 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Imputation Strategies:**\n",
    "- For Categorical Features (e.g., Credit Score: Excellent/Fair/Poor)\n",
    "  - Replace missing values with the most common category.\n",
    "- For Numerical Features (e.g., Income)\n",
    "  - Replace missing values with the mean/median of the observed values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problems with Simple Imputation**\n",
    "- ❌ Can introduce bias (e.g., assuming everyone missing \"age\" is 40).\n",
    "- ❌ Can misrepresent reality (e.g., assuming all missing loans are 3-year loans).\n",
    "- ❌ May not be correct at prediction time.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Approach 3: Modifying Decision Trees to Handle Missing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of skipping or guessing, modify decision trees to handle missing values natively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Does This Work?**\n",
    "- Allow the model to learn how to deal with missing values.\n",
    "- Modify decision trees to assign missing values to a specific branch.\n",
    "- **Example:** If Income is missing, send it down the \"Low Income\" branch.\n",
    "- This optimizes tree splits to minimize classification error.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Making Decision Trees Robust to Missing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, decision trees split on features (e.g., Credit Score).\n",
    "But if Credit Score is missing, what should we do?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Assign missing values to the best branch based on past\n",

    "### Regular Decision Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "- Split on Credit Score → Poor.\n",
    "- Split on Income → Missing Value → ❌ Can’t Proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modified Decision Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "- Split on Credit Score → Poor.\n",
    "- Income is Missing → Send to “Low Income” branch (or another branch based on error minimization).\n",
    "- Prediction is made despite missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimizing Decision Trees for Missing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Every decision node in the tree decides where to send missing values. The algorithm learns from data where missing values should go.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose the branch that minimizes classification error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Choosing the Best Split for Missing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try placing missing values in Branch A.\n",
    "2. Try placing missing values in Branch B.\n",

    "## What is Boosting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting is a meta-learning technique that enhances the performance of weak classifiers. It iteratively trains weak models, giving more weight to the misclassified examples in each round.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common weak classifiers used in boosting:**\n",
    "- Decision Stumps (shallow decision trees)\n",
    "- Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Boosting?\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✔ Reduces bias (improves weak classifiers)\n",
    "- ✔ Lowers variance (reduces overfitting)\n",
    "- ✔ Outperforms individual models\n",
    "- ✔ Wins machine learning competitions (Kaggle, KDD Cup, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Idea Behind Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of training a single complex model, boosting trains multiple simple models and combines their outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Loan Classification**\n",
    "- Classifier 1: Splits on income\n",
    "- Classifier 2: Splits on credit history\n",
    "- Classifier 3: Splits on loan term\n",
    "- Final Prediction: Weighted combination of all classifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ensemble Learning: The Core of Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead of relying on a single decision tree, boosting combines multiple models.\n",
    "- Each model corrects errors made by the previous one.\n",
    "- Final decision = weighted vote of all classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Boosting Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Train a weak classifier (e.g., decision stump) on the dataset.\n",
    "2. Check which examples it misclassified.\n",
    "3. Increase the importance (weight) of misclassified examples.\n",
    "4. Train a new classifier with updated weights.\n",
    "5. Repeat this process for T iterations.\n",
    "6. Combine all classifiers into a strong model.\n",

    "## Understanding the AdaBoost Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) was one of the first practical boosting algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Developed by Freund & Schapire in 1999.\n",
    "- Works by iteratively improving weak classifiers.\n",
    "- Uses a weighted voting system to combine weak models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AdaBoost Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize equal weights for all training examples.\n",
    "2. Train a weak classifier $ f_t(x) $ on the weighted dataset.\n",
    "3. Compute the weighted error:\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   \\text{error} = \\sum (\\text{weight of misclassified points})\n",
    "   $\n",
    "4. Compute the classifier’s importance:\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   w_t = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln \\left( \\frac{1 - \\text{error}}{\\text{error}} \\right)\n",
    "   $\n",
    "5. Update example weights:\n",
    "   - Increase weight of misclassified points.\n",
    "   - Decrease weight of correctly classified points.\n",
    "6. Repeat for T iterations.\n",
    "7. Final prediction is based on weighted sum of classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How AdaBoost Improves Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Face Detection**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Classifier 1 detects edges.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Focuses on hard-to-classify examples.\n",
    "- Combines multiple weak models into a strong one.\n",
    "- Automatically assigns higher weights to better classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AdaBoost Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "- Guarantees that training error decreases to zero as iterations increase.\n",
    "- However, if boosting runs too long, it may overfit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overfitting in Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike decision trees, boosting is resistant to overfitting. However, if too many weak classifiers are added, test error may increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Prevent Overfitting?\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✔ Use cross-validation to choose the optimal number of iterations (T).\n",
    "- ✔ Regularization (limit complexity of weak learners).\n",

    "Suppose 90% of restaurant reviews are negative. A classifier that always predicts \"negative\" achieves 90% accuracy – but it’s useless! It never identifies positive reviews, which are essential for a marketing campaign.\n",
