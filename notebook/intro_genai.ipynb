    "# Introduction to Generative AI\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Understanding AI, Machine Learning & Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into Generative AI (GenAI), the course first explains the fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AI** is a branch of computer science that creates intelligent systems that can reason, learn, and act autonomously.\n",
    "- **Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of AI where models learn from data instead of being explicitly programmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of ML models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Supervised Learning:** Uses labeled data to train models (e.g., predicting tips based on past restaurant bills).\n",
    "- **Unsupervised Learning:** Works with unlabeled data to find hidden patterns (e.g., clustering employees based on tenure and income).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Deep Learning & Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deep Learning (DL)** is a subset of ML that uses artificial neural networks to process complex patterns in data.\n",
    "- **Neural Networks** mimic the human brain with interconnected nodes (neurons).\n",
    "- **Semi-supervised learning:** Uses a mix of labeled and unlabeled data to train models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Where Does Generative AI Fit In?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generative AI** is a subset of Deep Learning, meaning it leverages artificial neural networks.\n",
    "- Generative AI differs from traditional ML:\n",
    "  - **Discriminative models** classify data points (e.g., is this image a dog or cat?).\n",
    "  - **Generative models** learn the probability distribution of data and generate new data points (e.g., creating an entirely new image of a dog).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. What Can Generative AI Do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative AI creates new content rather than just classifying existing data. Some examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Text Generation** (e.g., Chatbots, LLMs like Gemini and LaMDA)\n",
    "- **Image Generation** (e.g., Stable Diffusion)\n",
    "- **Audio and Video Generation** (e.g., AI-generated music or deepfake videos)\n",
    "- **Code Generation** (e.g., AI-assisted programming)\n",
    "- **3D Model Generation** (e.g., creating 3D assets for video games)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Generative AI vs Traditional ML\n",
    "\n",
    "A traditional ML model predicts an output (e.g., a number or class label), whereas a Generative AI model learns patterns and creates new content.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example:** If input = “What is sales?”, a traditional ML model might predict a probability (e.g., likelihood of a sale), while a GenAI model would generate a full-text definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Large Language Models (LLMs)\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are a subset of Generative AI that process text-based inputs and generate human-like text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do they work?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Given an input prompt, they predict the next word based on probabilities from training data.\n",
    "- **Example:** “I’m making a sandwich with peanut butter and…” → likely response: “jelly”.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. The Role of Transformers in Generative AI\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformers revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) in 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A transformer consists of an encoder-decoder structure:\n",
    "  - The encoder processes the input.\n",
    "  - The decoder generates the output.\n",
    "- While powerful, transformers can hallucinate (generate incorrect or nonsensical content).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Prompt Engineering: Controlling AI Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "- A prompt is the input text given to an AI model to guide its output.\n",
    "- Prompt design is crucial to obtaining high-quality AI responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Types of Generative AI Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Different models serve different input-output functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Text-to-Text:** Language translation, summarization (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini).\n",
    "- **Text-to-Image:** Generates images from text prompts (e.g., DALL·E, Stable Diffusion).\n",
    "- **Text-to-Video:** Generates videos from text prompts.\n",
    "- **Text-to-3D:** Creates 3D models from text descriptions.\n",
    "- **Text-to-Task:** Automates workflows, assists with web navigation, or modifies documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. Foundation Models: The Backbone of Generative AI\n",
    "\n",
    "Foundation models are large AI models pre-trained on massive datasets and can be fine-tuned for specific applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LLMs** (e.g., Gemini, LaMDA)\n",
    "- **Vision models** (e.g., Stable Diffusion for image generation)\n",
    "- **Code models** (e.g., AI-assisted coding, debugging, and SQL query generation)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11. Google Cloud’s Generative AI Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Cloud offers tools for developers and businesses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vertex AI Studio:** Helps developers build and deploy Generative AI models.\n",
    "- **Vertex AI Agent Builder:** Enables low-code/no-code AI solutions for chatbots, digital assistants, and knowledge bases.\n",
    "- **Gemini AI:** A multimodal model capable of handling text, images, audio, and code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12. Applications of Generative AI\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative AI is being used in many industries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Healthcare:** Drug discovery, patient diagnosis.\n",
    "- **Finance:** Fraud detection, risk assessment.\n",
    "- **Customer Support:** Chatbots, automated responses.\n",
    "- **Education:** Personalized learning content.\n",
    "- **Entertainment & Creativity:** AI-generated music, writing, and gaming assets."
