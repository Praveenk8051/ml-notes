    "# Multiple Regression Model\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Multiple Regression?**\n",
    "Instead of just one input feature ($ X $), we use multiple features $ X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_d $.\n",
    "\n",
    "**General form:**\n",
    "$ Y = w_0 + w_1 X_1 + w_2 X_2 + \\ldots + w_d X_d + \\epsilon $\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $ w_0 $ is the intercept.\n",
    "- $ w_1, w_2, \\ldots $ are regression coefficients.\n",
    "- $ \\epsilon $ is the error term.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Polynomial Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Extends linear regression by including higher-order terms of a single feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Instead of modeling $ Y = w_0 + w_1 X $, we add powers of $ X $, like:\n",
    "$ Y = w_0 + w_1 X + w_2 X^2 + w_3 X^3 + \\cdots + w_p X^p + \\epsilon $\n",
    "This allows the model to capture curvature.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Feature Engineering & Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Transforming Inputs into Features\n",
    "Features don’t always have to be raw inputs. They can be functions of inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "Instead of using just $ X $ (square footage), use:\n",
    "$ X, X^2 $ (quadratic), $ \\sin(X) $, $ \\log(X) $, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Seasonality Example (Time-Series Modeling):**\n",
    "Housing prices often fluctuate seasonally. We can model this with sinusoidal features:\n",
    "$ Y = w_0 + w_1 T + w_2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi T}{12}\\right) + w_3 \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi T}{12}\\right) + \\epsilon $\n",
    "This accounts for cyclical trends, e.g., higher house prices in summer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications Beyond Housing:**\n",
    "- Weather Forecasting: Uses multiple seasonal patterns (daily, yearly).\n",
    "- Flu Monitoring: Flu cases rise and fall seasonally.\n",
    "- E-Commerce: Seasonal demand forecasting for products (e.g., winter coats).\n",

    "- Works well for small datasets.\n",

    "- $ \\nabla RSS $ is the gradient:\n",
    "$ \\nabla RSS = -2H^T (Y - HW) $\n",

    "**Intuition:**\n",
    "- If the model underestimates the effect of a feature, its coefficient increases.\n",
    "- If it overestimates, the coefficient decreases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- Works for large feature spaces.\n",
    "- Avoids expensive matrix inversion.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Requires careful tuning of learning rate.\n",
    "- Can get stuck in local minima (though less of a problem for regression).\n",

    "\n",
    "The coefficient $ w_j $ represents the impact of feature $ X_j $ on the output when all other features are held constant.\n",

    "- $ w_1 $ = How much the price changes per additional square foot, holding bathrooms constant.\n",
    "- $ w_2 $ = How much price changes when adding a bathroom, assuming square footage remains fixed.\n",

    "**Caution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Coefficients depend on the context of the model. If we omit important variables, coefficients might be misleading.\n",

    "# Evaluating Regression Models\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Loss Functions: Measuring Error\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, we define a loss function to measure how bad our predictions are.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Loss Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Absolute Error (L1 Loss)**\n",
    "$ L(y, \\hat{y}) = |y - \\hat{y}| $\n",
    "Measures the absolute difference between actual and predicted values.\n",
    "Less sensitive to outliers compared to squared error.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Squared Error (L2 Loss)**\n",
    "$ L(y, \\hat{y}) = (y - \\hat{y})^2 $\n",
    "Penalizes large errors more than absolute error.\n",
    "Leads to models that prioritize minimizing large deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Training vs. Generalization Error\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training Error\n",
    "\n",
    "The error computed on the same data the model was trained on.\n",
    "Formula:\n",
    "$ \\text{Training Error} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} L(y_i, \\hat{y}_i) $\n",
    "Problem? It’s often too optimistic since the model has already seen this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generalization Error\n",
    "\n",
    "The true error on unseen data.\n",
    "Cannot be computed exactly because we don’t have access to all possible future data.\n",
    "Goal: Find a good approximation using test error.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Overfitting vs. Underfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Model fits training data too well, capturing noise instead of real patterns.\n",
    "Symptoms:\n",
    "- Very low training error, but high test error.\n",
    "- Poor performance on new data.\n",
    "Cause: Model is too complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Underfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Model is too simple to capture patterns in data.\n",
    "Symptoms:\n",
    "- High training and test error.\n",
    "- Fails to represent underlying trends.\n",
    "Cause: Model lacks capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Test Error: Estimating Generalization\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Do We Need Test Error?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since generalization error is unknown, we approximate it using test error:\n",
    "$ \\text{Test Error} = \\frac{1}{N_{\\text{test}}} \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\\text{test}}} L(y_i, \\hat{y}_i) $\n",
    "Key Property: Test data must be completely unseen by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Bias-Variance Tradeoff\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning models suffer from two main types of errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bias (Error due to assumptions)\n",
    "\n",
    "If a model is too simple, it makes strong assumptions → High Bias.\n",
    "Example: Linear model trying to fit non-linear data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variance (Error due to sensitivity)\n",
    "\n",
    "If a model is too complex, it becomes sensitive to training data variations → High Variance.\n",
    "Example: High-degree polynomial regression fitting noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tradeoff\n",
    "\n",
    "Low Bias + Low Variance = Ideal Model (but difficult to achieve).\n",
    "We aim for a balance between bias and variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Error Decomposition: Three Sources of Error\n",
    "\n",
    "For any given prediction, total error can be decomposed into:\n",
    "$ \\text{Total Error} = \\text{Bias}^2 + \\text{Variance} + \\text{Irreducible Error} $\n",
    "- Bias: Error due to model assumptions.\n",
    "- Variance: Sensitivity to training data.\n",
    "- Irreducible Error: Noise inherent in data (cannot be eliminated).\n",
    "Goal: Find the right model complexity that balances bias and variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Training, Validation, and Test Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "To properly evaluate models, we split data into three sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Training Set**\n",
    "   Used to train the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Validation Set**\n",
    "   Used to tune hyperparameters (e.g., degree of polynomial).\n",
    "   Helps in model selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Test Set**\n",
    "   Completely untouched data.\n",
    "   Used for final performance assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Model Selection Using a Validation Set\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Not Use Test Data for Model Selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "If we optimize a model based on test data, it’s no longer a fair estimate of generalization.\n",
    "Solution? Introduce a validation set:\n",
    "- Train models with different complexities.\n",
    "- Select the best model based on validation error.\n",
    "- Finally, evaluate on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Cross-Validation (When Data is Limited)\n",
    "\n",
    "When we don’t have enough data to split into training, validation, and test sets, we use cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### K-Fold Cross-Validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Split data into K subsets (folds).\n",
    "- Train on K-1 folds, test on 1 fold.\n",
    "- Repeat K times and average results.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Overfitting & Bias-Variance Tradeoff\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex models (like high-degree polynomials) have low bias but high variance, making them sensitive to training data. Simpler models have high bias but low variance and fail to capture underlying patterns. The goal is to balance bias and variance for optimal predictive performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Polynomial Regression**\n",
    "- A quadratic fit may capture general trends.\n",
    "- A 16-degree polynomial will overfit, showing extreme fluctuations.\n",
    "- When overfitting occurs, the magnitude of model coefficients increases significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge regression penalizes large coefficients by adding an L2 norm term to the cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost function is modified to:\n",
    "$ RSS(w) + \\lambda \\sum w_j^2 $\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- RSS(w) = Residual Sum of Squares (fit to data)\n",
    "- $ \\lambda $ (lambda) = Regularization parameter controlling penalty strength\n",
    "\n",
    "**Effect of $ \\lambda $:**\n",
    "- Large $ \\lambda $ → Shrinks coefficients (reducing complexity)\n",
    "- Small $ \\lambda $ → Similar to Least Squares Regression (can overfit)\n",
    "- $ \\lambda = 0 $ → Regular least squares regression\n",
    "- $ \\lambda \\to \\infty $ → All coefficients approach 0 (very high bias, underfitting)\n",
    "- $ 0 < \\lambda < \\infty $ → Balanced complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "# Algorithm for Ridge Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "**Closed-Form Solution**\n",
    "The ridge regression parameters can be computed using:\n",
    "$ w_{ridge} = (H^T H + \\lambda I)^{-1} H^T y $\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $ H $ = Feature matrix\n",
    "- $ I $ = Identity matrix\n",
    "- $ \\lambda I $ ensures the inverse exists, even when features are highly correlated or there are more features than samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gradient Descent Formulation**\n",
    "Ridge regression can also be solved iteratively using gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weight update rule is:\n",
    "$ w_j(t+1) = (1 - 2 \\eta \\lambda) w_j(t) - \\eta \\frac{\\partial RSS}{\\partial w_j} $\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first term shrinks the coefficient.\n",
    "- The second term updates based on the gradient of RSS.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Cross-Validation for Choosing $ \\lambda $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\lambda $ must be tuned automatically to avoid manually testing different values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**K-Fold Cross-Validation:**\n",
    "- The dataset is split into K equal parts.\n",
    "- Each subset is used as a validation set while the others are used for training.\n",
    "- The error across all folds is averaged to find the best $ \\lambda $.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV):**\n",
    "- Uses each data point one at a time as a validation set.\n",
    "- More accurate, but computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Handling the Intercept Term\n",
    "\n",
    "The ridge penalty shrinks all coefficients, including the intercept $ w_0 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two possible solutions:**\n",
    "1. Exclude the intercept from regularization by modifying the identity matrix.\n",
    "2. Center the data around zero before applying ridge regression (common in practice).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Feature Selection in Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection is crucial for efficiency, interpretability, and improving model performance. It helps in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reducing computation: If we have an extremely large feature set (e.g., 100 billion features), computation becomes infeasible.\n",
    "- Improving interpretability: Understanding which features matter most (e.g., in house pricing, not every tiny detail, like having a microwave, is important).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explicit vs. Implicit Feature Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explicit methods:** Search for the best subset of features using algorithms like all subsets selection and greedy methods.\n",
    "- **Implicit methods:** Use regularization techniques like Lasso Regression to automatically shrink coefficients and perform feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. All Subsets Feature Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Examines every possible feature combination to find the best subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Procedure:**\n",
    "1. Start with no features (baseline model).\n",
    "2. Add one feature at a time, computing training error for each.\n",
    "3. Select the best one-feature model.\n",
    "4. Move to two-feature models, pick the best.\n",
    "5. Continue until all features are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitation:**\n",
    "- Computationally infeasible: If there are $ D $ features, the number of models evaluated is $ 2^D $, which becomes impossible for large $ D $.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Greedy Algorithms for Feature Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid computational cost, we use heuristic approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Forward Stepwise Selection:**\n",
    "  - Start with no features and add one at a time, choosing the best improvement at each step.\n",
    "  - Limitations: Might miss optimal feature sets because once a feature is included, it stays.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Backward Stepwise Selection:**\n",
    "  - Start with all features and remove them one by one.\n",
    "\n",

    "### 3. Regularization-Based Feature Selection (Lasso Regression)\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of manually searching for the best subset, Lasso (L1 Regularization) automatically shrinks some feature coefficients to exactly zero, removing them from the model.\n",

    "- Uses L1 norm ($|w|$ instead of $w^2$ in Ridge).\n",
    "- Geometrically, L1 forms a diamond shape constraint, which increases the probability of hitting an axis and setting some coefficients to zero (sparseness).\n",

    "### 4. Optimization of Lasso: Coordinate Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Lasso lacks a closed-form solution, we solve it using Coordinate Descent, which:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Updates one coefficient at a time while keeping others fixed.\n",
    "- Uses a technique called soft-thresholding, which shrinks small coefficients to zero.\n",
