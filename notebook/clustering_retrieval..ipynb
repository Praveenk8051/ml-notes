    "\n",
    "This course is part of a machine learning specialization designed to be taken in sequence. It focuses on two key concepts: clustering and retrieval, both widely used in practical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Retrieval:** Finding similar items (e.g., recommending similar products, suggesting related news articles, matching social media users).\n",
    "- **Clustering:** Grouping data into meaningful categories (e.g., segmenting customers, detecting topic clusters in documents, categorizing images).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike previous courses in the specialization, which covered regression and classification, this course focuses on unsupervised learning techniques.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Concept:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a query document, find the most similar document in a dataset.\n",

    "  - **Trade-off:** It may make short and long documents seem equally similar when they aren't.\n",
    "- **Hybrid Approaches:** Different distance metrics for different features (e.g., cosine similarity for text, Euclidean for numerical features like view counts).\n",

    "- **Brute-force search (Linear Scan):**\n",

    "\n",
    "## 5. Introduction to Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional document retrieval, which finds similar documents based on input queries, clustering is about discovering structure in data.\n",
    "Goal: Group similar documents (or data points) without predefined labels.\n",
    "Example: Articles about sports, world news, or entertainment are grouped automatically without explicit category labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Clustering as an Unsupervised Learning Task\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Supervised Learning:** Has labeled training data (e.g., house price prediction, sentiment analysis).\n",
    "- **Unsupervised Learning (Clustering):** No labels; the algorithm must discover structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Given word count features of documents, the model groups them based on similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cluster Representation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each cluster is defined by its centroid (mean position) and its shape (e.g., ellipses).\n",
    "- Assignment is based on distance to cluster centroids.\n",
    "- The process is iterative—assign points → update centroids → repeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. K-Means Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize k cluster centers randomly.\n",
    "2. Assign each data point to the closest cluster (using Euclidean distance).\n",
    "3. Update cluster centroids to be the mean of points in the cluster.\n",
    "4. Repeat steps 2 & 3 until convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Centroid-Based:** Uses mean to determine cluster centers.\n",
    "- **Partitioning Method:** Each data point is assigned to exactly one cluster.\n",
    "- **Sensitive to Initialization:** Poor starting points lead to suboptimal solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### K-Means++ (Smart Initialization)\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of random initialization, K-Means++:\n",
    "- Picks the first centroid randomly.\n",
    "- Selects subsequent centroids proportional to squared distance from existing centroids.\n",
    "- Ensures better separation of clusters.\n",
    "- Leads to faster convergence and better clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Evaluating Clustering Quality & Choosing k\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cluster Heterogeneity\n",
    "\n",
    "Sum of squared distances between points and their assigned centroid.\n",
    "Lower heterogeneity = better clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing k:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Elbow Method:** Plot heterogeneity vs. k. Choose k at the point where adding more clusters results in diminishing returns.\n",
    "  - Too small k: Overly broad clusters.\n",
    "  - Too large k: Overfitting (clusters too small to be meaningful).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Parallelizing K-Means Using MapReduce\n",
    "\n",
    "Since K-Means needs to process large-scale data, we can distribute it using MapReduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MapReduce Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Map Phase (Classification Step):**\n",
    "  - Assigns each data point to the closest cluster center.\n",
    "  - Emits (cluster label, data point) pairs.\n",
    "- **Reduce Phase (Recenter Step):**\n",
    "  - Aggregates data points for each cluster.\n",
    "  - Computes new centroids (mean of points in each cluster).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Iterative Process:** Since K-Means is an iterative algorithm, MapReduce needs to be run multiple times until convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimizations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Combiner Step:** Local aggregation before reducing, reducing network communication.\n",
    "- **Efficient Data Partitioning:** Ensure balanced workload across machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. Applications of Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering is widely used across industries:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Information Retrieval**\n",
    "   - Google News: Groups similar articles together.\n",
    "   - Search Engines: Clusters documents to improve recommendations.\n",
    "2. **Image Clustering**\n",
    "   - Google Images Search: Clusters similar images.\n",
    "   - Ambiguous Queries (e.g., \"Cardinal\"): Groups images into categories (bird, baseball team, religious figure).\n",
    "3. **Healthcare & Medicine**\n",
    "   - Patient Segmentation: Identifies subgroups with similar medical conditions.\n",
    "   - Seizure Classification: Groups seizure types for better treatment.\n",
    "4. **E-commerce & Recommendations**\n",
    "   - Amazon Product Clustering: Groups products based on purchase history.\n",
    "   - User Clustering: Groups users with similar buying behavior for personalized recommendations.\n",
    "5. **Crime Forecasting & Housing Prices**\n",
    "   - Crime Prediction: Clusters geographic regions with similar crime patterns to improve forecasting.\n",
    "   - Housing Market Analysis: Groups similar neighborhoods for better price predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecture extends K-means clustering by introducing probabilistic model-based clustering, specifically Mixture Models and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The motivation is to address K-means' limitations, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hard assignments of data points to clusters\n",
    "- Assumption of equal-sized, spherical clusters\n",
    "- Inability to handle overlapping or elongated clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Probabilistic Clustering?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Real-world data is often not clearly separable.\n",
    "- Some points may belong to multiple clusters with varying probabilities.\n",
    "- K-means ignores cluster shapes and assumes equal importance for all dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mixture Models & Soft Assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations of K-Means\n",

    "## Clustering vs. Mixed Membership Models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clustering Models (e.g., K-means, Gaussian Mixture Models)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Group similar articles into disjoint clusters.\n",
    "- Assign each document to a single topic (hard or soft assignment).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** A document about epileptic events might be classified into science (Cluster 4) or technology (Cluster 2) but not both.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mixed Membership Models (e.g., LDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Allow documents to belong to multiple topics with different proportions.\n",
    "- **Example:** A document could be 40% science, 60% technology.\n",
    "- Each word in the document can be assigned to a different topic.\n",

    "## Inference in LDA: Learning Topics from Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we only observe words, LDA needs to infer:\n",
    "- Topic-word distributions (which words belong to which topics).\n",
    "- Document-topic distributions (which topics are present in each document).\n",
    "- Word-topic assignments (which topic each word belongs to).\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is that we don’t know these parameters beforehand. We need inference algorithms to estimate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expectation-Maximization (EM) vs. Gibbs Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA could be solved with EM (Expectation-Maximization), but:\n",
    "- MLE-based estimation overfits in high-dimensional spaces.\n",
    "- The E-step becomes intractable due to complex probability distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bayesian Approach to LDA\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA is typically solved using a Bayesian approach, which:\n",
    "- Accounts for uncertainty in model parameters.\n",
    "- Regularizes estimates to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "- Uses Gibbs Sampling instead of EM.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gibbs Sampling for LDA\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Gibbs Sampling?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method that iteratively refines topic assignments. Instead of computing the exact posterior, it samples values from conditional distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Randomly reassigns each word to a topic, considering:\n",
    "  - How prevalent the topic is in the document.\n",
    "  - How likely the topic is to generate the word.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps of Gibbs Sampling in LDA\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize topic assignments randomly for each word in the corpus.\n",
    "2. For each word in each document:\n",
    "   - Remove its current assignment.\n",
    "   - Compute probability of assigning it to each topic using:\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     P(Z_{iw} = k \\mid \\text{other assignments}) \\propto P(\\text{topic } k \\mid \\text{document } i) \\times P(\\text{word } w \\mid \\text{topic } k)\n",
    "     $\n",
    "   - Sample a new topic assignment from this distribution.\n",
    "   - Update topic counts.\n",
    "3. Repeat until convergence or computational budget is exhausted.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Resampling a Word**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we are reassigning the word \"neuron\":\n",
    "- If the Science topic has many words in this document, $ P(\\text{Science} \\mid \\text{Document}) $ is high.\n",
    "- If \"neuron\" appears frequently in Science articles, $ P(\\text{\"neuron\"} \\mid \\text{Science}) $ is high.\n",
    "- The new topic is sampled based on the product of these probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Collapsed Gibbs Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization Trick: Marginalizing Out Model Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of sampling the topic-word and document-topic distributions separately, we integrate them out. This simplifies the problem to sampling only the word-topic assignments.\n",

    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- Faster convergence.\n",
    "- Reduces parameter space.\n",
    "- More efficient for large-scale data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trade-offs:**\n",

    "1. **Topic Discovery in Large Text Corpora**\n",
    "   - Uncover hidden themes in news articles, research papers, or social media.\n",
    "   - **Example:** Analyzing Reddit discussions to identify trending topics.\n",
    "2. **Document Classification & Tagging**\n",
    "   - Documents can be classified into multiple categories based on their topic mixture.\n",
    "   - **Example:** A tech article might be 30% AI, 40% cybersecurity, 30% blockchain.\n",
    "3. **Information Retrieval & Search**\n",
    "   - Instead of keyword matching, search engines can retrieve topic-related documents.\n",
    "   - **Example:** A search for \"deep learning\" may return AI-related articles.\n",
    "4. **Personalized Recommendations**\n",
    "   - User preferences can be modeled as topic distributions.\n",
