    "## Why Do We Need Vector Spaces?\n",
    "\n",
    "Words can have similar meanings even if they don‚Äôt share the same characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "- **\"Where are you heading?\"** vs. **\"Where are you from?\"** ‚Üí Different meaning despite similar words.\n",
    "- **\"What‚Äôs your location?\"** vs. **\"Where are you?\"** ‚Üí Similar meaning despite different words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector spaces help quantify these relationships by encoding words as numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications of Vector Spaces in NLP:\n",
    "- **Text similarity:** Helps in question answering, paraphrasing, summarization.\n",
    "- **Semantic relationships:** Detects word dependencies (e.g., \"cereal\" and \"bowl\" are related).\n",
    "- **Information retrieval:** Search engines rank documents based on vector representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "üöÄ **Famous NLP Principle:** ‚ÄúYou shall know a word by the company it keeps‚Äù ‚Äî John Firth\n",
    "\n",
    "(i.e., words appearing in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings.)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Construct Word Vectors?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two common ways to build vector space representations:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Co-Occurrence Matrices (Word-by-Word Design)\n",
    "- Measures how often words appear together within a fixed distance.\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "  - Corpus: \"Data science is simple. Raw data is useful.\"\n",
    "  - Word: \"data\"\n",
    "  - If \"data\" appears within 2 words of \"simple\", the count is updated.\n",
    "  - Each word is represented as a vector of co-occurrence counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Word-by-Document Matrix\n",
    "- Instead of words, we track how often words appear in documents (topic-based).\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "  - Word: \"data\"\n",
    "  - Occurrences: 500 times in Entertainment, 6620 in Economy, 9320 in Machine Learning.\n",
    "  - Words like \"film\" may have high frequency in Entertainment but low in Economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "üöÄ **Key Insight:**\n",
    "- Vector representations allow document clustering ‚Üí Similar topics appear closer in vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Measuring Word and Document Similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "Once words are transformed into vectors, we need a way to compare their similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Euclidean Distance (Straight-Line Distance)\n",
    "- Measures how far apart two vectors are.\n",
    "- **Formula:**\n",
    "  $\n",
    "  d(A, B) = \\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2}\n",
    "  $\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "  - \"Entertainment\" and \"Machine Learning\" documents have a Euclidean distance of 10,667.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue:**\n",
    "- Does not account for vector magnitude (size differences).\n",
    "- A long article vs. a short article about the same topic might be far apart.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cosine Similarity (Angle-Based Similarity)\n",
    "- More effective than Euclidean Distance for comparing word/document vectors.\n",
    "- **Formula:**\n",
    "  $\n",
    "  \\text{cosine similarity} = \\frac{A \\cdot B}{||A|| \\times ||B||}\n",
    "  $\n",
    "- If cosine similarity ‚âà 1, vectors are very similar. If ‚âà 0, they are unrelated.\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "  - \"Agriculture\" and \"History\" might be far apart (large Euclidean distance) but similar (small cosine angle).\n",
    "\n",
    "üöÄ **Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "- **Euclidean Distance** is good for small-scale problems.\n",
    "- **Cosine Similarity** is better for comparing large documents or word embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Word Arithmetic: Using Vectors for Meaning\n",
    "\n",
    "You can manipulate word vectors using basic arithmetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "- **\"USA\" + \"Washington DC\"** ‚Üí Produces a vector difference that represents the relationship between a country and its capital.\n",
    "- If we apply the same difference to **\"Russia\"**, we should get **\"Moscow\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "üöÄ **Word Analogies Using Vectors**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"King\" - \"Man\" + \"Woman\" ‚âà \"Queen\"**\n",
    "- **\"Paris\" - \"France\" + \"Germany\" ‚âà \"Berlin\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dimensionality Reduction: PCA for Visualizing Word Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Word vectors are high-dimensional (hundreds of dimensions). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) helps reduce dimensions while preserving important relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "- Words like \"city\" and \"town\" or \"oil\" and \"gas\" appear closer together in lower dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PCA Uses:\n",
    "- **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors** to extract important features.\n",
    "- Projects word vectors into a **2D or 3D space** for visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "üöÄ **Why Use PCA?**\n",
    "- Helps understand relationships between words.\n",
    "- Reduces computational cost in NLP tasks.\n",

    "# Word Translation with Word Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the fundamental applications of NLP is machine translation. The goal is to translate an English word (e.g., **hello**) to its French equivalent (**bonjour**) using word embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Can a Machine Learn to Translate?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create word vectors for both English and French words.\n",
    "2. Find a transformation (matrix **R**) that maps English vectors to French vectors.\n",
    "3. Search for the nearest vector in the French space to get the translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Role of Word Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "- English and French word embeddings exist in different vector spaces.\n",
    "- The goal is to find a transformation (**R matrix**) to align these spaces.\n",
    "- Instead of creating a hardcoded dictionary, we can train the model on a small word set and generalize to unseen words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding the Transformation Matrix (R)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "- **X** = matrix of English word embeddings.\n",
    "- **Y** = matrix of French word embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "We optimize **R** using Gradient Descent to minimize:\n",

    "$\n",
    "||XR - Y||_F^2\n",
    "$\n",

    "(Frobenius norm): Measures the difference between transformed English words and actual French words.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Updating R:** Uses gradient descent to minimize this difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "üöÄ **Key Insight:** By learning **R**, we can translate words without needing a direct dictionary!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finding Similar Word Vectors with Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have transformed the English vector into the French space, we need to find the closest French word vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brute Force K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Given a word vector, compare it with all words in the French space.\n",
    "- Find the **k** closest words using **cosine similarity** or **Euclidean distance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "üí° **Problem?**\n",
    "- If we have millions of words, this brute-force search is slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Faster Solution: Hash Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead of searching through every word vector, we divide vectors into **buckets**.\n",
    "- Similar vectors get placed into the same bucket.\n",
    "- Hashing allows us to search efficiently within a smaller set.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) for Faster Search\n",
    "\n",
    "To speed up nearest neighbor search, we use **Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Hashing?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Think of a cupboard with drawers.\n",
    "- You store similar items in the same drawer.\n",
    "- Instead of searching through everything, you only check one drawer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each word vector is assigned a **hash value** based on a hash function.\n",
    "- **Example hash function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\text{Hash Value} = \\text{Word Vector} \\mod 10\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "üí° **Problem?**\n",
    "- This simple method doesn‚Äôt guarantee that similar words end up in the same bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)\n",
    "\n",
    "LSH fixes the problem of basic hashing by ensuring that similar words get hashed to the same bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Does LSH Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Divide the vector space using **random hyperplanes** (splitting lines).\n",
    "2. Assign hash values based on which side of the hyperplane the vector falls.\n",
    "3. Similar words will likely fall into the same bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "üöÄ **Example: Finding Nearby Friends**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Imagine you are visiting San Francisco.\n",
    "- Instead of checking every friend in the world, you only check the ones in the USA.\n",
    "- **LSH does the same thing for words**‚Äîit reduces the search space to relevant groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Foundation of LSH\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each **hyperplane** divides the space into two regions.\n",
    "- Compute **dot product** between the word vector and the normal vector of the hyperplane.\n",
    "  - **Positive dot product** ‚Üí One side of the plane.\n",
    "  - **Negative dot product** ‚Üí Other side of the plane.\n",
    "- Assign **binary hash values** (0 or 1) based on sign.\n",
    "- Combine multiple hash values to get a **unique region (bucket)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use LSH?\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Much faster than brute-force search.\n",
    "‚úÖ Efficiently finds **approximate nearest neighbors**.\n",
    "‚úÖ Trade-off between accuracy and speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Document Search with LSH\n",
    "\n",
    "Another application of nearest neighbor search is **document retrieval**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Represent Documents as Vectors?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Words have **vector representations**.\n",
    "- A document can be represented as **the sum of its word vectors**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding Similar Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Query:** \"Can I get a refund?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convert the query into a **document vector**.\n",
    "2. Find the **nearest documents** using LSH.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible matches:**\n",
    "- \"What‚Äôs your return policy?\"\n",
    "- \"May I get my money back?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "üöÄ **Why is this useful?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- LSH allows **fast document retrieval** for search engines, chatbots, and Q&A systems.\n",
